Booting 
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT is in /etc/default/grub (Open with nano)
*Unable to change grub theme*
1. Install the theme that you wish to use in /boot/grub/themes/
2. Go to /etc/default/grub.d/
3. Check there is a 99_breeze-grub.cfg file
4. In that file you will find the theme.txt file it's pointing to for the new theme.
5. Change the location path, the default for Breeze is:
    GRUB_THEME=/boot/grub/themes/breeze/theme.txt
6. Change to the correct theme where it says <themefolder>
    GRUB_THEME=/boot/grub/themes/<themefolder>/theme.txt


*SDDM Theme doesn't look correct*
**Aspects of the theme are off**
1. Go to /usr/share/sddm/themes/ where your sddm themes live
2. Go into the theme you wish to change
3. Now you need to find where in the theme that component is stored, my first choice would be to look in theme.conf, then theme.conf.user, then any of the *.qml files in that folder which relate, after, check components/

**Enable HiDPI**

*Lock screen*
** Does not look the same as sddm theme **
SDDM theme and locking screen (meta + L) are different components made to look the same. Locking screen is themed by Global theme.
User installed Global themes are installed ~/.local/share/plasma/look-and-feel/<theme name>/contents/lockscreen

Linux-Surface
*Touchscreen, Pen, Shutdown and Reboot not working*
Add intel_iommu=off to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT in /etc/default/grub
